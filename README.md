<h3>Description:</h3> 
(Not So) Simple Cloudflare DNS record updater for people on dynamic IP addresses.

<h3>Motivation:</h3>
I rely on cloudflare for many things for my lab - and i do not feel comfortable exposing my Cloudflare API keys to third-party apps. Plus, I wanted a friday night challenge.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<i><b>*USE AT YOUR OWN RISK*</i></b>
I developed this for personal use - and do not intend to maintain this for other users. Feedback is welcome.

<h3>TODO (might never happen):</h3>

- Instead of relying on third party services to check external IP, develop api interface for certain routers (i.e. Mikrotik)
- Support Mikrotik RouterOS scripting
- Support other DNS providers
- Support Webhook notifications for certain messaging systems (Slack, MS Teams, Twilio)
